This repository contains the completed cybersecurity internship tasks as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## 📝 Overview

The project includes two key tasks from the cybersecurity domain:

1. **Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer**  
   Developed a Python program using Scapy to capture and analyze network packets in real-time.  
   The tool extracts and displays source/destination IPs, protocols, ports, and payloads, and logs results to a file for further analysis.

2. **Task 2: Phishing Awareness Training**  
   Created a comprehensive PowerPoint training module to educate users about phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and how to identify and avoid phishing attempts.  
   The presentation includes real-world examples and an interactive quiz integrated at the end of the slides.
